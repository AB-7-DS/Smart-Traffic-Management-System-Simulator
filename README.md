## üìñ Overview

The **Smart Traffic Management System** is a practical project designed to replicate real-world traffic management in a city.It is a dynamic traffic management system designed to simulate a city's road network. The system supports essential functionalities like managing intersections, displaying traffic statuses, handling blocked and under-repair roads, and routing vehicles through the network.

# ‚ú® Features

## Graph Representation:
- Represent the city's road network as a directed graph with intersections as vertices and roads as edges.
- Support for dynamic graph updates, including adding and removing vertices and edges.

## Interactive Dashboard:
- **Interactive Console Menu** for users to manage the simulation and handle operations, including:
  - Display the traffic network in the form of an adjacency list.
  - Block, unblock, or mark roads as under repair dynamically.
  - Handle emergency and regular vehicle routing.
  - Manage traffic lights.

## Blocked and Under-Repair Roads:
- Mark roads as blocked or under repair, and ensure routing algorithms respect these road statuses.
- Dynamic updates on road conditions with real-time display of blocked and under-repair roads.

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Find and display the shortest path between two intersections while considering road conditions.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** / **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore all possible paths between two intersections, regardless of road conditions.
- **Traffic-Aware Pathfinding**: Automatically account for road closures, repairs, or accidents when calculating paths.

## Congestion Monitoring:
- Real-time tracking of traffic congestion based on the number of vehicles in different areas of the city.
- Congestion status can be displayed and updated based on vehicle movement and road conditions.

## Emergency Vehicle Routing:
- Prioritize emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) in the traffic system, enabling faster and safer paths during emergencies.
- Dynamically reroute emergency vehicles, bypassing congested or blocked areas for optimal response times.
- Handle special **emergency vehicle routing** algorithms that factor in road conditions and vehicle priorities.

## Traffic Lights Management:
- Control **traffic light timings** for intersections, allowing dynamic adjustments to optimize traffic flow.
- Traffic light status can be updated manually or automatically based on real-time congestion and vehicle movement data.
- Integration with vehicle routing to ensure that traffic lights are synchronized with the flow of traffic.

## CSV Data Support:
- Load **road network** and **road closure** data from **CSV files** for seamless integration with real-world data or simulation updates.
- Support for importing and exporting traffic data to facilitate further analysis or reporting.

## Vehicle Simulation:
- Simulate the movement of **regular vehicles** and **emergency vehicles** across the road network.
- Dynamic vehicle routing that adapts to road conditions and traffic management settings.
- Track and manage vehicle attributes such as **speed**, **position**, and **destination**.

## Real-Time Data Updates:
- Monitor and update road conditions, vehicle positions, and other relevant data in real-time to reflect the current status of the simulation.
- Provides users with an up-to-date view of the simulation as it evolves.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions



## Prerequisites

- A **C++ compiler** supporting **C++11** or later (e.g., GCC/Clang/MSVC).
- **SFML 2.61** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) installed.
- **Make** installed for building the project.
- A **terminal** or **IDE** (e.g., VSCode, CLion) for compilation and execution.
- Run this in ubunbu for visualization and sfml (preferrable).If you wan to use this in Windows then comment the visual part of download specific version of sfml and change a code for it.
## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository

Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

```

### 2. Install SFML 2.61

Make sure SFML 2.61 is installed on your system. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

#### For Ubuntu :

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

### 3. Ensure Make is installed

Make sure that Make is installed on your machine. If not, install it:

#### For Ubuntu :

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
### 4. Build the Project Using Make

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal, where the Makefile is located, and run:

#### For Ubuntu :

```bash
make
```

### 5. Run the Program

Once the project is compiled, run the program with:

#### For Ubuntu :

```bash
./app
```
